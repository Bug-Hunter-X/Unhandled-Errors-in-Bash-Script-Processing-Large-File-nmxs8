This repository contains a bash script that demonstrates an uncommon error:  failure to handle potential errors when processing large files. The script lacks error handling, potentially leading to out-of-memory errors or unexpected termination due to failures in the called command ('some_command').  The solution demonstrates robust error handling and memory-efficient processing techniques.
